                    <p>The Catholic Diocese of Enugu ("Diocese", "we", "us", or "our"), through its Directorate of Social Communications, operates the CDERegistry.org.ng website, which serves as a platform for recording and managing ecclesiastical data (including parish census information and sacramental records such as birth, baptism, confirmation, first communion, marriage, and death registries). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect through the Site, how we use and protect that data, who has access to it, and your rights regarding your personal information. The policy applies to all users of the Site, including clergy, parish officers, and members of the public who submit or access data for sacramental or administrative purposes. We handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including Nigeria's data protection laws. By using the Site or submitting information, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
                    <p>We collect and process personal data for clear and specific purposes related to the mission and operations of the Catholic Diocese of Enugu. The primary purposes include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Ecclesiastical Record-Keeping:</strong> To record, update, and maintain sacramental records (e.g. baptisms, confirmations, marriages, etc.) and other church-related registries or census data. This ensures that the Diocese and its parishes have accurate records of sacraments and membership for ecclesiastical administration and pastoral care.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> To provide you with the services of the Site, such as allowing authorized users to input new records, search or verify existing records, and request official extracts or certificates of sacramental records.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To contact individuals when necessary regarding their entries or requests — for example, to clarify information on a submitted form, to notify when a certificate is ready, or to send important announcements related to the registry services. We may also use contact information to respond to inquiries you submit through the Site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statistical and Planning Purposes:</strong> To compile anonymized statistics about sacramental trends or parish demographics that help the Diocese in pastoral planning and resource allocation. (Any statistical reports will not identify individuals and are used internally for the betterment of church administration.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">We will not use your personal data for purposes unrelated to the above without obtaining your consent, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. We do not use the data collected through this Site for any commercial marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Types of Data Collected</h2>
                    <p>The types of personal information we collect through CDERegistry.org.ng depend on your interactions with the Site and the services you use. This may include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Personal Identification Information:</strong> such as full name, date of birth, gender, and contact details (address, phone number, email). For example, when recording a baptism, we may collect the child's and parents' names, addresses, and contact information; for a marriage record, we collect the couple's names and contact details, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sacramental and Ecclesiastical Details:</strong> information specific to church records, like dates and locations of sacraments (baptism, confirmation, first communion, marriage, etc.), names of officiating clergy, godparents/sponsors, and any certificate numbers or registry book references. For death records, information may include date of death and place of burial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parish Membership and Census Data:</strong> if you participate in a parish census or registration, we might collect information about your parish affiliation, family members in the parish, and other demographic information helpful to church administration (e.g., age group, marital status, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Credentials (for authorized users):</strong> If you are clergy or a parish officer with an account to input or manage data, we collect login credentials (username, password) and possibly role information (e.g., your parish or position) to authenticate and authorize your access. Passwords are stored in an encrypted form and not visible to us.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us or submit inquiries/feedback through the Site or via email, we may keep a record of that correspondence, which could include your name, email address, and the content of your message, in order to respond to you and improve our services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Data (Cookies and Usage):</strong> The Site may automatically collect certain technical information when you visit, such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and browsing actions. We use cookies and similar technologies to ensure the Site functions properly and to enhance user experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data outside of what is necessary for ecclesiastical purposes. The sacramental information collected inherently relates to religious affiliation and practice, which is considered sensitive; we handle this data with a high level of care and confidentiality. We also do not collect or process financial information through this Site, as there are no financial transactions on CDERegistry.org.ng.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">How We Use Your Data</h2>
                    <p>Personal data collected via the Site will be used solely for the purposes for which it was provided, or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. Specifically:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Maintaining Records:</strong> We use the information you provide to create and update official diocesan records (for example, recording that a baptism or marriage took place on a certain date at a certain parish). These records serve as the official ecclesiastical record for sacramental and administrative purposes within the Catholic Church.</li>
                        <li><strong>Providing Services to You:</strong> If you request a service via the Site — for instance, searching for your baptismal record or requesting a copy of a sacrament certificate — we will use your personal data to fulfill that request. This might involve verifying your identity or eligibility to access certain records, and then retrieving the relevant information for you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Administration:</strong> We may use personal data for internal operations necessary to run the registry system. This includes troubleshooting issues, data analysis, testing, and research to improve the functionality and reliability of the Site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We will use contact information (email, phone) to communicate with you about matters related to the Site or your records. This may include responding to your questions, informing you of updates or changes to registry procedures, sending reminders for incomplete registrations, or alerting you to important changes in our Terms or Privacy Policy. We will not send unrelated marketing communications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> We may process and disclose personal data as required to comply with legal obligations or valid governmental requests (for example, responding to a court order). Additionally, in the unlikely event of investigating misuse of the Site or violations of the Terms and Conditions, we might review relevant personal data as part of taking appropriate action.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">We ensure that any use of personal data is compatible with the original purpose of collection. We do not use your personal data for automated decision-making or profiling in a way that significantly affects you, except insofar as displaying relevant records to authorized users might be considered a form of automated data processing. Any new use of your data beyond what is covered in this Policy will be communicated to you and, if necessary, we will obtain your consent or provide an opportunity to opt-out.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="mb-8">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Who Has Access to Your Data</h2>
                    <p>We treat personal data collected through the Site as confidential and do not share it with unauthorized third parties. Access to your data is restricted to the following, on a need-to-know basis:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Diocesan and Parish Officials:</strong> Authorized personnel within the Catholic Diocese of Enugu — such as the diocesan registry administrators (within the Directorate of Social Communications) and designated parish priests or parish secretaries — have access to the records pertinent to their duties. All such personnel are bound by confidentiality obligations and the policies of the Diocese to protect your data.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Individual Data Subjects:</strong> If you are the subject of a record (or the parent/guardian of a minor subject), you may be allowed access to your own records. Requests for personal sacramental records may require identity verification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers (Data Processors):</strong> We may engage trusted third-party service providers to help us operate the Site or manage data. Such service providers may have incidental access to data only to perform services on our behalf. We require these providers to implement strict security measures and we contractually bind them to confidentiality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal or Regulatory Disclosure:</strong> We will not share your personal data with any government agency, law enforcement, or third party unless required by law or if you give us explicit consent. However, we may disclose information if we, in good faith, believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the Diocese or users of the Site, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of others, or (d) investigate or assist in preventing any violation of law or this Site's Terms and Conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">Importantly, we do not sell or rent personal data to any third parties for marketing or any other purposes. Your information is used solely for church-related administrative purposes as outlined.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Data Security Measures</h2>
                    <p>We understand the importance of safeguarding the personal and ecclesiastical information stored in our systems. The Diocese takes the security of your data seriously and implements a variety of measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of personal data. Our security practices include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Secure Hosting:</strong> The Site is hosted on secure servers with up-to-date security protocols. We use firewalls and network monitoring to protect our systems from intrusions. All data transmission between your browser and the Site is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS encryption) to prevent eavesdropping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Personal data in the registry is accessible only to authorized users. Each authorized clergy or staff user has unique login credentials, and their access is limited based on role.</li>
                        <li><strong>Password Protection:</strong> User passwords are required to meet minimum strength criteria and are stored in our database in a hashed/encrypted format. We also encourage authorized users to periodically change their passwords and to use two-factor authentication if it is made available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Employee/Staff Training:</strong> Clergy, staff, and any volunteers who are granted access to personal data are educated about the importance of confidentiality and data protection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Encryption and Backup:</strong> Sensitive personal data may be encrypted at rest in our databases. Regular backups are performed to ensure records are not lost, and these backups are stored securely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring and Testing:</strong> We monitor the Site for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Regular security assessments and maintenance are conducted. If any security breach is detected, we will act promptly to contain and investigate it, and we will notify affected users and appropriate authorities as required by law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> When we use third-party service providers (data processors), we vet their security practices to ensure they meet our standards. All contracts with such providers include data protection and security requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">Despite our diligent efforts, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data with commercially acceptable means, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You can help by keeping your account credentials confidential and alerting us if you detect any unusual activity. In the unlikely event of a data breach involving your personal data, we will inform you and take all legally required steps to remedy the situation.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Data Retention</h2>
                    <p>The Catholic Diocese of Enugu retains personal data collected through the Site for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by canon law or civil law, whichever is longer in certain cases. Our retention practices are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Sacramental and Ecclesiastical Records:</strong> In the Catholic Church, sacramental records (such as baptism, confirmation, marriage registers) are typically kept permanently, as they serve as an historical and canonical record of an individual's status in the Church.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parish Census/Registration Data:</strong> General parish membership information or census data may be updated periodically. Outdated information may be archived or deleted as it becomes irrelevant for active administration.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> If you are an authorized user (clergy or staff) with an account on the Site and you cease to hold that position or your account is inactive for an extended period, we may deactivate or delete the account credentials.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communications and Inquiries:</strong> Emails or inquiries sent to us may be retained for a period necessary to address your request and for our records.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In some cases, we may need to retain data for a certain period to comply with Nigerian law or diocesan administrative policies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">When data is no longer needed and no longer subject to required retention, we will ensure it is disposed of securely. Please note that due to the nature of sacramental records, most personal data you provide for those records will become part of a perpetual record that is not subject to typical deletion upon request.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="mb-8">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                    <p>We are committed to upholding your rights regarding the personal data we collect and process. Depending on applicable law (including Nigeria's data protection regulations) and consistent with church policies, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. This means you can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal information and request a copy of that information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If you believe that any personal data we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request corrections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Deletion (Right to Erasure):</strong> You may request that we delete personal information we hold about you. However, please note that this right is not absolute and can be subject to important exceptions. Sacramental records, by their nature, are part of the permanent historical records of the Church and generally cannot be deleted entirely without authorization from competent Church authority and consideration of canonical law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to ask us to restrict or pause the processing of your data under certain circumstances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may have the right to object to certain types of data processing, such as processing for statistical purposes or any direct communications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> For data that you provided to us directly and that we process by automated means, you might have the right to request that we provide it back to you or to a third party in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> In cases where we rely on your consent to process data (if any), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us using the information provided in the Contact Information section below. We will respond to legitimate requests within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">Finally, if you feel your rights over your personal data have been infringed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority. In Nigeria, this would be the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) or its successor. We encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our best to address your concerns.</p>

                    <p>Protecting the privacy of children and minors is extremely important to us. Our policies regarding minors' data are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>No Direct Use by Young Minors:</strong> The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13 for direct use. Children do not typically create accounts or directly enter data on this Site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> For any personal information about a minor that is submitted through the Site (such as details of a child's baptism or first communion), it is presumed that such submission is done with the consent of the child's parent or legal guardian.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage of Minors' Data:</strong> Information about minors is collected only for ecclesiastical purposes (like creating a baptism record). We do not use a child's personal data for any secondary purposes such as marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rights of Minors:</strong> If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected personal information about a child without proper consent, please contact us immediately. As a child reaches adulthood, they gain the rights over their own data as described in Your Rights above.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">Our approach is to handle minors' data with the highest degree of care and security, recognizing the additional responsibility involved. The Diocese also follows any applicable child data protection guidelines and Church child-protection policies in managing information about minors.</p>
